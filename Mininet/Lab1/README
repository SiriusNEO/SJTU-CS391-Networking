How to run the Iperfer:
    java Iperfer -c -h <server hostname> -p <server port> -t <time> (client mode)
    java Iperfer -s -p <listen port> (server mode)

File Structure:
    logs/               (store *.log, some results when running ping and iperfer)
    measurement/        (the measurement folder required in assignment doc)
    command             (some collections of the command I run in mininet, just for convenience)
    Iperfer.java        (the source code of my Iperfer)
    *.class             (the compiled java bytecode generated by javac)
    Mininet-Lab1.docx   (assignment doc)
